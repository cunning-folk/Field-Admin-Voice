# The Field - Tummo Yoga Trainings

## Classical Methods, Contemporary Practices

Inner fire meditation helps to rewire our conceptual and experiential understanding of the body. In this experiential course, you'll learn how to integrate Tummo breathwork with the nondual view of Dzogchen to catalyze deep healing, unwavering presence, and unconditional kindness. You'll learn to safely engage with intense sensations, emotions, and bliss states while remaining grounded in the experience of immediate, open, non-interpretive awareness.

## Tummo Yoga Training - January 21, 2026

In this eight-week intensive, Peter McEwen and Lama Karma Wall will guide students into the completion-stage practices of Chandali, drawing from Rangjung Dorje's *Zabmo Nangdon* (Tibetan: ཟབ་མོ་ནང་དོན), a 14th-century treatise on prana, bindu, and nadi.

The course will focus on:

- Igniting the inner fire
- Deepening vase breathing
- Refining subtle body visualization
- Working directly with the blazing and dripping cycles of Tummo

Subsidiary yogas of day, night, and dream will be introduced, with an emphasis on integration into daily meditation practice. This module is intended for those who have a strong meditation foundation.

This year's cohort will extend and deepen the practices cultivated in earlier groups, carrying forward their momentum while expanding the range of postures and opening new perspectives on Chandali. The inner fire yoga opens the possibility of recognizing the illusory forms that arise in practice as expressions of emptiness, consistent with the Anu and Dzogchen view.

## Instructors

### Lama Karma Justin Wall

Teaches Mahamudra and Dzogchen meditation, making esoteric practices accessible without dilution. Columbia graduate who completed traditional three-year retreats. He is also the lead designer and facilitator for aNUma, a company bringing sacred group experiences in virtual reality to persons with terminal illness.

### Peter McEwen

Peter McEwen teaches Buddhist meditation through the lens of lived complexity, not spiritual abstraction. Grounded in three decades of traditional training, he offers tools for metabolizing experience as it actually arrives: messy, vivid, and alive.

Since 1993, he's studied under Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, Tulku Orgyen P'huntsok, Lama Pema Dorje Rinpoche, and Bruce Tift, and has completed the traditional three-year retreat curriculum. Grounded in three decades of traditional training, Peter brings Vajrayana into direct conversation with the realities of modern life.

In a society that prioritizes output, meditation and mindfulness practices are often conflated with self-optimization. Instead, we can view meditation as a tool that reveals our immediate experience—discomfort and all—as a reliable source of well-being and problem-solving.

## Core Philosophy

Tummo will not help us transcend our messy human lives. Instead, we aim to dissolve the apparent conflict between messy and transcendent. The confluence of posture, breath retention, and visualization is an arena where we can challenge habitual ways of framing our experience. Tummo supports the practice of owning our disturbance and healing the apparent split of the divided self.

## Practicing Together

When you join the Inner Fire course, you enter a field of committed practitioners. These are people who aren't just seeking tools; they are testing their lives as vessels for clarity, embodiment, and freedom.

Together, we explore how imaginal practice, somatic attention, and tantric view can illuminate the places where we still contract, perform, or delay. This course doesn't promise transcendence. It offers methods of posture, breath, and visualization for working directly with the raw material of energy, sensation, and patterns of bewilderment.

### Common Challenges We Address

**Difficulty integrating breakthrough experiences into daily life.** It's not just that we struggle to maintain awakened states. It's that we keep mistaking ourselves for something to manage, something to idealize, improve, or accept. This course invites a more dangerous move: to stop treating the self as an object altogether.

**The oscillation between self-improvement and self-acceptance.** As long as we treat identity as something to manage or repair, we reinforce the split we're trying to heal. This course invites a deeper move: learning to stay with contradiction without collapsing it into a story, strategy, or fixed self.

**Overwhelm and existential intensity.** Breath and visualization help expand your capacity to stay with what's hard to hold. These practices train a nervous system that can hold charge, clarity, and contact without defaulting to collapse or dissociation.

**A sense that meditation or therapy no longer touch what matters.** When insight feels distant or stale, this course reawakens imaginal practice. Not as fantasy, but as a precise way to engage the architecture of self: breath, form, sensation, and the symbolic codes that shape experience from within.

**Emotional reactivity that hijacks clarity.** We don't override or analyze. We enter. These practices offer embodied, imaginal strategies for meeting difficult states with radical kindness, turning anxious feelings into doorways instead of threats.

**A scattered or mechanical practice.** If your practice feels fragmented or stale, this course helps you root it in a coherent, sustainable rhythm—through breath, image, and awareness. Not just impactful, but alive. Methods you can inhabit.

## Recent Discussions

### Talking About Deity Yoga (Deconstructing Yourself Podcast)

Discussion with Michael Taft about devotion in meditation practice, the need for stability in groundlessness, and the ontological status of deities in Vajrayana practice. Topics included common failure modes of practice, how to handle formless panic, and the magical matrix of the Guhyagarbha tantra that illustrates bardo meditation and the union of emptiness and vivid appearance.

The conversation touched on why deity yoga continues to hold such lasting power and beauty within the Vajrayana tradition, examining that diaphanous intersection where visualization, somatic experience, and mystery converge. We went deep into the mechanics of transformation, the necessity of paradox, and why these practices remain particularly relevant for contemporary practitioners.

Discussion with Michael Taft exploring embodied immediacy, navigating disturbing experiences, cultivating open awareness, and how the traditional Tibetan Buddhist practice of Tummo helps us to be more familiar with any refusal to go into experiential intensity.

## Benefits of Tummo Practice

### Stress Inoculation & Nervous System Dexterity

When we practice Tummo's movements and breath retention method, we bolster our innate ability to endure existential intensity without dissociating into a habitual reactive response.

### The Unexcelled Method

Tummo encourages us to participate wholeheartedly in the vivid appearance of our experience. Inner fire meditation dismantles the habit of taking appearances as having an objective and essential nature.

### The Death Process

Tummo familiarizes the practitioner with the stages of death and the dissolution of the subtle energetic elements. When a person dies naturally, their elements dissolve into each other. This process is a method of the completion yogas.

### Health Benefits

Tummo's raison d'être is nondual experience; however, it also offers a plethora of peripheral benefits. Digestive fire, enhanced immunity, creative power, fortified libido, and feeling of lightness and well-being are all earmarks of engagement with the method.
