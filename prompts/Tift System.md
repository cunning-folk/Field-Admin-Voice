## Tift - 5 Levels of Disconnection

### 1

**Disconnection:** Fundamental aggression towards the truth of our experience.

**Antidote:** Disciplined awareness and unconditional kindness.

### 2

**Disconnection:** Dissociative relationship with our immediate embodied experience.

**Antidote:** Embodied immediacy

### 3

**Disconnection:** Stream of self-referential commentary

**Antidote:** Practice removing the claim that any experience is about us. Feeling the raw aliveness of emotion without making it a story about our ‘self’.

### 4

**Disconnection:** Linking moments of experience to one another. Creates an illusion of continuity.

A**ntidote:** Reframe stories to support personal responsibility and health. Practice immediacy to help dismantle any story, however positive.

### 5

**Disconnection:** Stabilizing a state of chronic struggle by maintaining the claim that some problem of survival-level significance has to be fixed.

**Antidote:** Invite what we don’t want to feel into awareness and acceptance. Practicing holding contradictory feeling, with no fantasy of resolution.

## Support

Sit down and relax. Make sure you feel comfortable. Wherever you’re sitting, put attention on what you can feel in your body. Notice the weight of your body as you begin the meditation. Feel the seat, the chair, the cushion, or the floor that you’re sitting on. Feel how it is supporting you. You don’t have to do anything to deserve that support. All you have to do is feel it. Feel your body as it is resting on the earth. What is it like to have that support—support that you don’t have to earn or purchase? You don’t have to perch on your chair. The chair will support you. Become aware of your breath. Feel that your breathing is supporting you. It doesn’t matter if you’re neurotic or sane, a good person or a bad person, happy or sad. Your breath is supporting you, regardless. It may not last forever, but for right now, your breath is supporting you. Your body is supporting you. Remember all of the incredibly complex systems that come together to form your body. Your skeleton . . . your muscles . . . your mind. Your body is supporting you; you don’t have to do anything to deserve support from your body. The planet is supporting you. There’s a workable range of temperature . . . the atmospheric gases are in just the right proportions. Gravity is working well . . . the seasons are working. You don’t have to do anything to deserve any of that support. It’s already present. Relax into the reality that you’re already being supported. Perhaps not perfectly, but adequately. You could imagine that even this crazy society is supporting you. There’s food in the grocery store and gas at the pumps . . . people generally follow the law . . . the streets are paved . . . and the electricity works. It’s not perfect, but even society is supporting you in its own way. You don’t have to deserve it. Society is still going to be operating. Allow yourself to feel that sense of support. It’s always present. You don’t have to do anything to deserve it or create it. See what it would be like to relax into a state of well-being in this moment. Rest in the unconditional experience of well-being and support. You don’t have to do anything to make it happen. All you need to do is relax into the way things already are.

## Simple Meditation

Sit down in whatever posture feels upright, awake, and comfortable enough to not call attention to any bodily tension or pain. Begin by paying attention to your breathing, without commentary. Once you feel settled, attend to any experiencing that arises. Maintain a sense of open curiosity and awareness. If you become fascinated with some drama or dialogue, return to your breathing as a way to return to embodied immediacy. Practice with a sense of nothing to accomplish, only appreciating your irresolvable and unending stream of experiencing.

Look for what is beneath our neurotic patterns. Recognize that those patterns represent our best effort to take care of ourselves. If we can appreciate our neurosis and work with it instead of attacking it we can learn to work more effectively with our patterns. The point of our aggressive stance is to get out of an experience of disturbance as quickly as possible.

Full participation in our immediate experience.

Cultivate a type of well-being that isn't dependent on positive thoughts or emotions

Requires full participation in exactly what we don't want to feel. Remain embodied with our fears in order to generate the confidence that intense energies are not problematic in themselves
