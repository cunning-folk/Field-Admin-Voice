# Tummo Yoga Training FAQ

## Course Logistics

**Where does the course take place?**

Online, from wherever you are. No travel required.

**Can I join from my timezone?**

The live sessions are most accessible for US and European practitioners,
but everything is recorded. We've had people join from Germany, the UK,
Australia, and elsewhere. The asynchronous option works well if the
timing doesn't fit.

**What's the time commitment?**

Live sessions run about 60 minutes weekly on Wednesday evenings. Office
hours are about an hour on Saturday mornings, optional but valuable for
clarifying practice questions. Daily practice varies: 15-60 minutes
depending on where you are in the curriculum and your capacity on any
given day. Course materials are self-paced.

**What if I can't attend live?**

All sessions are recorded and posted to the platform. Many practitioners
work primarily from recordings and use office hours to catch up.

## Prerequisites & Experience Level

**Do I need meditation experience?**

Some experience helps but isn't strictly required. Practitioners come
from Vipassana, Zen, jhana practice, and other traditions. If you've
developed some **meditative pliability and stability**, the capacity to
sustain attention and work with what arises, that will serve you well.
We build from there.

**Do I need experience with visualization?**

No. Many practitioners arrive with solid concentration skills but little
detailed imagery practice. The course includes visualization training as
part of the curriculum.

Here's something important: you don't need to generate crystal-clear
images to practice effectively. What matters is the capacity to **act as
if** and to arouse firm **vajra pride**, the confidence that you are the
luminous form you're generating. Some people have **aphantasia**, the
inability to form mental images, and they can still work with these
practices through what we call **feeling-imagination**: the ability to
sense and play with the body's boundaries and energetic qualities. The
pride and "as if" orientation offset any limitations from visual
inexperience.

**Do I need to be affiliated with Tibetan Buddhism?**

No. The class doesn't require cultural or religious affiliation. The
only requirement is being a human being with curiosity and grit. The
Field exists to broaden access to methods that have been unnecessarily
gated. We remove cultural barriers while maintaining practice integrity.

**I've done Wim Hof Method. Is this the same thing?**

There are superficial similarities: breathwork, cold exposure, stress
inoculation. But Tummo is a complete Vajrayana Buddhist practice that
includes visualization, subtle body work (**prana, bindu, nadi**), and
energy cultivation. More importantly, Tummo may not work at full
capacity unless there's meditative stabilization via visualization. The
components depend on each other. WHM optimizes for cold adaptation and
performance. Tummo treats the body as a **crucible for transformation**,
working with the full spectrum of embodied human experience.

## Who This Is For (And Who It Isn't)

**Who thrives in this course?**

Practitioners who take a detailed, practical, hands-on approach to their
own development. People who want to understand why something works, not
just follow instructions. Those who are tired of using the dharma as an
excuse to be self-aggressive. Craftspeople, not consumers.

If you sense there's more depth available than what you've accessed, if
you're willing to stay with complexity rather than collapse it, if you
want exposure to methods that are usually gated behind years of
preliminary practice, this is built for you.

**Who should probably look elsewhere?**

People seeking shortcuts or spiritual entertainment. Those who want to
use awakening as a bypass for psychological work. Anyone looking for
certainty, guarantees, or simple answers. If you're shopping for
specialness or collecting credentials, we're probably not a good fit.

This isn't a judgment. Different containers serve different purposes.
But The Field attracts a particular kind of practitioner, and the cohort
experience works better when there's alignment.

## Common Concerns

**I have a tendency to dissociate, close down, or avoid difficult
experience.**

Good. This is precisely what the practice addresses.

The habit of dissociation is relevant for even seasoned practitioners.
We often fluctuate between periods of vast spaciousness punctuated by
periods when we can't seem to relax into what is, thereby starting a
**micro-cycle of self-aggression and closure**. The unconscious tendency
to avoid feelings of disturbance and vulnerability doesn't disappear
with experience; it just gets subtler.

Tummo creates an environment of **stress inoculation** where we train
the capacity to remain present with intensity. We often crave a
tolerable amount of existential intensity, mystery, and vulnerability,
then employ selective attention to return to familiar regimes. The
practice helps us recognize this pattern and build tolerance for staying
present.

I want to be transparent: weeding out these **habitual cycles of
closure** is a specialty of inner heat yoga. It's not gentle work, but
it's good work.

**I'm concerned about safety after a challenging experience with other
breathwork methods.**

Fair concern. Some breathwork methods emphasize intensity without proper
scaffolding. They're arousal practices without the stabilization and
integration components.

Tummo is taught as a complete system: breath retention, vase breathing,
visualization, movement, and subtle body work together. The practices
are introduced gradually. We spend time building **meditative pliability
and stability** before adding heat.

Equally important: we emphasize **non-sleep deep rest** (Yoga Nidra) and
other methods to down-regulate the nervous system. This matters
especially for practitioners juggling careers, children, and full
schedules. You can't just keep revving the engine; you need practices
that support recovery. The course includes both arousal and restoration.

I'll also note: most traditional warnings about these practices were
contextual to 9th-century Tibet. The dangers were real in environments
without experienced guidance, adequate nutrition, or understanding of
trauma. With proper instruction and gradual progression, these practices
are accessible.

**What should I be feeling during practice?**

Early on, there's nothing specific you should be feeling. The work is
simply returning to **immediate embodied experience**: sensation,
breath, the felt sense of the body.

Over time, as prana enters the central channel, the sense that there's a
discrete state happening to a discrete person drops away. If there's any
sort of thing you should be feeling, eventually that becomes more of a
baseline experience rather than a special event.

But in the beginning? Just keep returning to sensation-level experience
and work with what comes up. The goal isn't to manufacture particular
states but to recognize our relationship to whatever arises.

**How does this relate to nervous system regulation and somatic
therapy?**

Contemporary methods like nervous system regulation and trauma therapy
help people work with the compulsive tendency to contract away from open
experience.

Vajrayana addresses the same tendency at the level of the **subtle
body**, using posture, breath, and visualization to dissolve the knots
that hold habitual experiencing in place. When the channels are knotted,
the winds of mind follow fixed routes. The vital essences stagnate.

Tummo brings these subtle components into conscious relationship. We
work with root causes rather than symptoms. Not by bypassing
psychological material, but by creating conditions where that material
can surface, be tolerated, and eventually be integrated.

Think of it this way: therapeutic work cleans up the environment of
inner experiencing. Spiritual practice provides the open awareness that
makes psychological material workable. They're mutually supportive, not
sequential tracks.

**I'm more interested in emotional and relational work than peak
states.**

Good. The practice isn't about achieving exotic states or becoming
performant.

We build tolerance for the full range of human experience: difficult
sensations, pleasant states, and everything in between. Over time,
practitioners begin to recognize that what they interpreted as anxiety
was actually **openness filtered through the machinery of the ego**. The
same intensity they tried to manage becomes workable material.

One thing I've noticed: many practitioners have a surprisingly low
**tolerance for well-being**. We unconsciously return to familiar
patterns of closure even when things are good. Tummo surfaces this
tendency. You discover not just your aversion to difficulty but your
subtle rejection of flourishing.

**I'm in therapy or working with trauma. Is this appropriate?**

These practices can complement therapeutic work when approached
responsibly. But they're powerful and can surface intense material.

If you're working with significant trauma, coordinate with your
therapist and mention this in your application. The question isn't
whether you have difficult history (most of us do) but whether you have
adequate support and whether the timing is right.

I think of it this way: **neurosis isn't pathology**. It's an adaptive
strategy that worked once, now decades out of date. We're not fixing
what's broken; we're updating what's obsolete. That update process can
be activating. Having support structures in place makes sense.

## The Practice Itself

**What makes Tummo different from sitting meditation?**

I find Tummo to be one of the most diverse practices I've encountered
within Vajrayana. I appreciate the challenge of the visualization
component, the embodiment-focused yoga postures, and the dynamic,
evocative experience of the breathwork. For me, it encompasses all
aspects of a fun, effective, and varied approach to working within
embodied human experience.

I find practicing Tummo to be a relief from some methods that have a
more arid or detached context. It focuses more on aliveness and movement
than some traditional sitting methods. While all methods deserve
respect, Tummo is easily my favorite.

**Is this a good re-entry point after a break from practice?**

Yes, and I personally endorse it for this purpose. The diversity of the
practice helps: visualization challenges, embodied postures, evocative
breathwork. There's enough variety that you're unlikely to slip into
stale patterns. And the stress inoculation element means you're actively
building capacity rather than just resuming a routine.

**What about the warmth and heat effects?**

The warmth is a side effect, useful historically for practitioners in
rugged retreat environments. But it's not the fruit of the practice. The
fruit is transforming the mind and consciously regulating subtle airs.

There are no negative effects from practicing in warmer seasons. I just
advise against practicing in direct warm sunlight.

**Does Tummo relate to death preparation?**

Yes. The practice familiarizes practitioners with the stages of death
and the **dissolution of the subtle energetic elements**. When a person
dies naturally, their elements dissolve into each other: earth into
water, water into fire, fire into air. Tummo rehearses this dissolution
consciously.

This isn't morbid. It's practical. We're all going to encounter this
territory eventually. The question is whether we meet it with
familiarity or bewilderment.

**What's the relationship between Tummo and Dzogchen?**

The inner fire yoga opens the possibility of recognizing the illusory
forms that arise in practice as expressions of emptiness, consistent
with the Anu and Dzogchen view. Tummo is a **completion stage** practice
that creates conditions conducive to recognizing **rigpa**, unfabricated
awareness.

In the course, we integrate Tummo breathwork with the nondual view of
Dzogchen to catalyze deep healing, unwavering presence, and
unconditional kindness. You learn to safely engage with intense
sensations, emotions, and bliss states while remaining grounded in
immediate, open, non-interpretive awareness.

## Practical Considerations

**Do I need special equipment?**

Minimal. A comfortable meditation seat (cushion, bench, or chair) and
space for movement practices. **Full lotus is not required.** Most
practitioners use Burmese style, tailor's pose on a zafu, or chairs.
What matters is a sustainable seated position.

As practice deepens, access to cold exposure (cold showers, ice baths)
can be useful, but it's not required from the start. Don't buy an ice
bath before you've learned to breathe.

**What if I have physical limitations?**

The practices can be adapted. Movement practices can be modified. If you
have specific physical concerns, mention them in your application and we
can discuss what's workable.

## Community & Support

**How do I ask questions during the course?**

Weekly office hours (Saturdays at 10am MST) provide direct Q&A and
clarification on practice questions. The Circle platform offers spaces
for asynchronous questions.

For practitioners who want more access to the teaching staff, the VIP
tier includes personalized coaching, one-on-one sessions, and direct
messaging. If something truly urgent arises, I'm available to help point
you in the right direction.

**What's the learning philosophy?**

We learn by teaching one another. Cohort participants have ample
opportunity to connect, share insights, and support each other's
practice. Many practitioners find the peer relationships as valuable as
the direct teaching.

**What happens after the course ends?**

Access to course materials remains available. Many practitioners join
other Field offerings (Dark Retreat, deity yoga courses) or continue
participating in community spaces.
