## Aliveness

It seems that one of the prompts for disembodiment or neurotic states is the robust habit of becoming absorbed in interpretations prompted by an avoidance of sensation-level experience. Practices like Dzogchen and Tummo can provide an interesting framework for directly appreciating and experiencing the full spectrum of aliveness at any given moment. 

Tummo supports the effort to attune to the winds' energetic movement and become more familiar with any refusal to go into experiential intensity. As soon as we avoid something, then it gives it the appearance of being an obstacle or ‘bigger’ than us. We’ll be doing some work with nervous system regulation to complement the Tsa Lung methods.

The Dzogchen sections of the course will address our fascination with distractions and our understanding that those distractions keep us from our panic or, let's say, openness/freedom.

## Responding to Dissociation Concerns

I think the habit of dissociation is relevant for even seasoned practitioners, so I understand your concerns. You will find that this method promotes an ability to engage fully with existential intensity. The practice requires consistent engagement with the method, but over time can yield great benefit.

We often crave a tolerable amount of existential intensity, mystery, and vulnerability. We then employ selective attention and focus on negative experiences and interpretations to support a familiar regime.

Even seasoned practitioners still have an unconscious tendency to avoid feelings of disturbance and vulnerability. So, for seasoned practitioners, we often fluctuate between periods of vast spaciousness punctuated by periods when we can't seem to relax into 'what is.' Thereby starting a micro-cycle of self-aggression and closure. Eventually, we hope to dissolve our compulsion to 'resolve' our experience into a neat little spiritual paradise. I think weeding out these habitual cycles of closure is a specialty of inner heat yoga.

## Sharing Background/Credentials (when contextually relevant)

I assume you have some sense of my practice and teaching orientation, but here's a brief overview: My main practices since 2005 have been Dzogchen and the Tummo practices of the Nyingmapa Anuyoga Tantra tradition. I've practiced in the Nyingma Vajrayana tradition since 1993, accumulating approximately 18,000 hours of retreat and practice time. My root teachers are Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, Lama Pema Dorje Ripoche, and Bruce Tift.

My background aligns with the teachings you've received, though I may emphasize embodiment more than other teachers you've worked with. When we focus practice through sensation-level experience, we can significantly broaden our tolerance for open experience. The reality is that when we encounter the uncertainty of an open mind, most of us instinctively collapse into familiar formulas and patterns to maintain a tolerable experience of existential intensity, mystery, and vulnerability.

## Responding to Practice Questions (confronting fear)

I appreciate your dedication to finding an embodied practice that resonates with you. Confronting the edge of fear is incredibly valuable work. I've observed that a primary challenge for meditators is the tendency to recoil from open experience into fearful narratives or to avoid difficult sensations. In such cases, the meditation practice is often driven by emotion. Our goal, I believe, is to utilize methods and practices that reveal the inherent transparency of our relationship to the phenomenal world, our emotional experience, and our fundamental cognizance.

An additional benefit of practicing Tummo is developing a more conscious relationship with stressors. This practice helps us recognize that these stressors are manageable and do not need to operate unconsciously. Instead, we can consciously engage with these vulnerable feelings, allowing them to surface, tolerating them, inviting them, and responding to them with kindness. This approach makes them less likely to dictate our behaviors and feelings.

## Describing the Practice (course inquiry)

I find Tummo to be one of the most diverse practices I've encountered within Vajrayana Buddhist methods. I appreciate the challenge of the visualization component, the embodiment-focused yoga postures, and the dynamic, evocative experience of the breathwork. For me, it encompasses all aspects of a fun, effective, and varied approach to working within our embodied human experience. I find practicing Tummo to be a relief from some methods that have a more arid or detached context, as it focuses more on aliveness and movement than some traditional sitting methods. While all methods are to be respected, Tummo is easily my favorite.

## Responding to Someone with Vipassana Background

It sounds like you have solid experience with Vipassana and other concentrative methods. This will be beneficial in establishing the meditative pliability and stability required for Tummo.

Regarding your question about whether Tummo is an ideal technique to re-engage with meditation after a break, I personally find it to be one of the most diverse practices I've encountered within Vajrayana Buddhist methods.

## On Tolerance for Well-Being

I think if you engage in this practice you begin to recognize more feelings of aliveness and pleasure in the body. I can't guarantee this, but that seems to be the pattern for the other students. The confluence of breath, posture, and meditation often create an environment where sensation level experience intensifies. We will be learning the rudiments of engaging with a sense of well-being and learning to maintain it. So often, we have a low tolerance for well-being and unconsciously seek to return to familiar patterns of closure and escape.

## On Breathwork and States

Gentle vase breathing and vase breathing, in general, are arousal practices. In meditation, we aim to balance arousal with recovery. Both arousal and restorative states are intrinsic to being an embodied human being. Over time, we strive to become acclimated, accepting, and tolerant—and ultimately kind—towards these different states, recognizing that all states arise and dissolve in an open experience. At some point in your development, the prana will enter the central channel, and the sense that there is a state happening to a specific person will drop away. So if there's any sort of thing you should be feeling, eventually that will become more of a baseline experience. But as you're just getting into these practices, I don't think there's anything you should be feeling. It's just a function of returning over and over to immediate embodied experience and working with what's coming up.

## Technical/Theoretical Response

Contemporary methods such as nervous system regulation and therapy help people often work with the compulsive tendency to contract away from open experience.

Vajrayana Buddhism addresses this same tendency at the level of the subtle body, using posture, breath, and visualization to dissolve the knots that hold habitual ways of experiencing in place.

When the channels are knotted, the winds of mind (prana) follow fixed and habitual routes. In turn, the vital essences (bindu) can stagnate, becoming agitated or "polluted."

The method of Tummo is to bring these subtle components into conscious relationship, clarifying the winds and essences so they no longer perpetuate fixation but instead serve natural functioning. The essential gesture is to guide prana into the central channel, where dualistic grasping can release and the vital essences can be alchemized into clarified radiance.

## On the Core Challenge

Practitioners want the truth, and in Buddhism the truth is stark: the persistent sense of self is fundamentally hallucinatory. What makes this hallucination so convincing is the way it feeds on unconscious patterns of aggression toward our own immediate experience. From the standpoint of the ego process, open experience feels threatening. Not because reality itself is menacing, but because a constructed self meeting nonpersonal reality experiences that contact as a threat.

The ego's continual work of turning raw sensation into "me" and "mine" interprets referenceless presence and unfiltered intensity as anxiety. This is the habit of recoiling from a conscious relationship with vulnerable experience.

Tummo enters here. Through breath retention, cold exposure, and visualization, it deliberately creates an environment of stress inoculation. These methods train the body-mind to increase its tolerance for well-being, to remain present with vulnerability, and to replicate the dissolution of "me" into recognition of the union of clarity and emptiness.

## On Jhana and Tummo

Regarding the relationship between Jhana and Tummo, if we take Jhana at face value, it refers to Samadhi, which we would consider a meditative absorption. Therefore, when we practice Tummo, we are indeed engaging in a Jhanic absorption. The combination of visualization, posture, and breathwork creates an environment conducive to slipping into a state of Samadhi or absorption, which can lead to bliss. While there is more to it, this provides a general outline of Tummo's method.
