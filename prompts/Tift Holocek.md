And so **I tend to see psychological work as a support for increasing the frequency of those moments of stepping out of any agenda and into immediate open awareness.** It's sort of like anybody who starts meditation it's probably intelligent for them to start  in a shrine room or something like that where it's quiet it's sort of uplifted, it's you know, it's spacious. In a similar way, **we can think of our therapeutic work as cleaning up the environment of our inner experiencing.**

I prefer to put openness, vulnerability, workability, and health as  my reference energy.

**Basically addressing our fascination with distractions, understanding that those distractions serve the function of keeping us out of our panic let's say or of openness.** And so from that point of view, it's not like there's a problem that's supposed to be healed. It's more like, it's not like a problem that there's traffic out in the street but that's not where you want to start meditating for practical reasons. There's not a problem that we have what we call neuroses, those are efforts to take care of ourselves but some people are going to investigate whether the benefit is worth the price tag they pay and maybe it might make sense to some people to consider that we actually have an investment in generating what we call problems.

Because I think our attention tends to stop at anything that we call a problem because it's like a threat and oh I've got to take care of this threat before I go any deeper. I don't want to be more vulnerable until I've solved this problem. Whether you know a hundred thousand years ago it's like there's a noise in the bush I want to figure out what it is you know am I going to eat it or is it going to eat me before I just you know sit down on this rock here take a snooze and I think it's I find it helpful just to assume that everything we're doing is our effort to take the best care of ourselves possible and it's just a matter of is it working and that depends on what our priorities are what our intentions are.

If somebody happens to be, maybe to start at the end of your question, I think increasingly it has made sense to me to **hold contradictory or opposing or different thoughts, feelings, experiences, emotions with no fantasy of resolution ever**. So it seems to me that actually is always the nature of our momentary experiencing. **What seems to me the best approximation of a complex, non-divided reality is to learn to hold contradictory views without taking sides.**

When I first wrote the book, it was more of an extension of so many different factors. Certainly, Trungpa Rinpoche was profound, but also just being married, having kids, doing my psychotherapy practice where it seemed obvious that **no one view, certainly including Buddhism, is going to capture the complexity of things.**

---

That's why I think one of the views of Vajrayana that probably always resonated, at first not so consciously, is **this idea of the aliveness, the intensity, the openness of engaging with apparently opposite experience without some fantasy that they're supposed to be an integration that leads to a new answer or reference point to take.** So that's the larger view probably.

And then developmentally, you know, I worked for (I'm still working actually) but for a long time in therapy, it just seemed very accurate to me over and over again that the way a person was engaging with their own experience, with their partner, with life, was very resonant with experiences they had as children growing up.

So that **basic Western view that our experience as young, dependent, immature little beings who have to adapt to their parents, their family, their gender training, their culture, all of that had a persistent and powerful influence. Most of us, in certain aspects of our life, especially the arena of intimacy or what is most vulnerable for us, tend to still unconsciously be engaging with our life, our experience, as if we're still a young child.** And that's not wrong of course, but for most of us it's decades out of date and is not really based on currently accurate experience or adult realities. So that developmental view, I think, is a very accurate, useful way of bringing out into one's awareness, out into the open, the possibility that much of what we take to be "just the way things are," especially in relationships and things like that, is a formula that we still rely on, but often the benefit is not worth the price tag.

Western therapy could be understood as our efforts to bring ourselves into conscious participation with our current adult capacities and our current adult realities. Because these young survival strategies are organized around (at least) emotional survival, we rarely want to mess with them because they're usually associated with a lot of anxiety, as it feels like survival. So it's not easy work.

A lot of different Western therapies are based on this idea that our young experience persists in inappropriate ways in the present and that there are a variety of ways to bring that into awareness, to challenge our identification with it, to cultivate a more adult capacity and sense of self. And probably our lives will work better because it's more in alignment with our current reality. I happen to think that's very useful.

I would probably bring that same view that we were just discussing and imagine that there are a variety of ways of relating those two, none of which is going to capture the complexity of our actual human experience.

**I am more of a fan of what works rather than what's true. I mean, we have to have adequately accurate relative experiencing or we'll make a lot of mistakes, but that's different than thinking that any view is going to capture the complexity of reality.** Views are just concepts or tools, I think.

Different things work for different people, and I usually encourage people to just do whatever seems to work. **But what works has to be in alignment with what's most important for that person, what their intentions are, what their priorities are.** So that's often a useful thing to start with.

If somebody is wanting to have an idea of a continuity between psychology and spiritual path work, then they should make use of that type of model. If somebody is interested in what we were talking about as far as training ourselves into coming back (because it's not easy of course), but coming back over and over again, at least as a practice, to that **non-graspable experiencing in between reference points**, then it's helpful to see them in sort of "well this focuses on this and this focuses on that." That happens to be more my bias given my priorities and values.

I would say that a major difference between the two is that Western therapy, as an expression of Western culture, takes the sense of being a self as just a given, as a reality. And so of course, Western therapy is going to appropriately be organized around improving and protecting that sense of self. Nothing wrong with that, it's just that I don't think that's really the most accurate understanding.

But a spiritual path, let's say (you know, so many different paths), but let's use **Buddhist, which is my training, would start to assert the view that there is a sense of self, a feeling of self, an appearance of self, but upon investigation, we're never going to find any essential nature to that appearance - no objective existence, no essential nature.**

So a more Buddhist view, I think, is to consider the potential for a conscious experience and unconditional freedom as the intention, rather than improving the quality of oneself as the intention. Those are pretty big differences actually.

But again, from a Buddhist point of view, we take the improving the quality of oneself as a relative appearance, so we don't have to try to disprove it or say it's wrong. But personally, I would say that that is less deep, carries less potential for deep transformative change as a Buddhist view. But that's my particular bias.

**Again, if we consider the view that any paradigm, any way of understanding, is probably going to be most effective if it's in alignment with our intentions rather than thinking it's a description of reality in some one-to-one way, then if from a Buddhist point of view the intention is openness, then unconditional kindness is a more useful attitude than to find pathology.**

---

I don't happen to see blind spots as nasty, dark problems. **I would prefer to reframe blind spots as out of date or inaccurate efforts to take the best care of ourselves possible.** And so that's how I usually present it to people I might work with.

You know, any understanding about why you're pretending to be a victim, for example - how is that taking care of yourself? What do you think you're protecting underneath that? Maybe without saying it's wrong to be that way. Because as soon as you say there are bad parts of being human (we're not saying there are not hurtful parts, there are not parts that harm ourselves or others), but "bad" is sort of a more moralistic use of "nasty."

As soon as we go there, then we are in dualistic organization and we're not in that open ground where every moment, whatever a moment is, every moment actually is fresh and open. There's no bias until we engage from a certain view.

So basically, **I prefer to understand and work with what we call neurosis as out of date efforts to take the best care of ourselves possible, rather than as a problem that's supposed to be healed or cured or somehow transcended.**

**The impulse to reify, I think, serves the function that if I have a solid reference point, then the implication unconsciously is that I'm a solid experiencer, observer, whatever. I think that's usually unconsciously the function.**

**I think it's very helpful to tease apart the process of reification - taking our experience as if it's of cosmic significance and as if it's personal - to tease that apart, which has to do with all of our experiencing, from specific relative experiencing like calling somebody evil or what they do evil, maybe to be more accurate.** But on a relative level, I don't know. I honestly don't know. I honestly don't have any clarity about whether on a relative level there exists what we could call evil, but it sure looks like it, you know. But I could simultaneously hold the view that this person is acting in a very evil way and it's probably coming out of very unconscious pain and confusion, but that doesn't excuse it.

And if that person is such a toxic presence in this life, I wouldn't have a problem with their being executed or something. I mean, I'm not a great Buddhist. If a mosquito gets on my hand, sorry, I usually say sorry, but I still go ahead and kill it. I'm with us, you know.

But if somebody, I think Trungpa Rinpoche, when I was quite young, I was such a relief when he at some point said that if he was in a room with somebody who was going to push the button and launch a nuclear war, he'd kill that person. And I said, "Well, what a relief. Here's somebody who's actually practical, not going to take refuge and always be nice or something."

That's a huge issue, of course, and there are so many different theories and practices. I think in my understanding, it's helpful to start with the obvious accuracy, or at least the possibility, that all of us on a relative level are just a collection of limitations. So the real question isn't, "Oh, how do I work with these few blind spots?" It's more like, "How is it that I have any clarity at all?"

To me, it's not about really healing something or getting rid of blind spots. It's more like having an attitude, like you said earlier. I've heard that, who knows, maybe 95% of our experience will never arise into conscious awareness, so we don't have any conscious choice.

To me, the point is to generate a conscious attitude and be open to whatever arises in the present moment, which will always be a relatively limited range of experiencing if we are not yet talking about just open awareness. I just assume that all of my experience is more limited than not, but there are certain types of limitations that can cause harm to myself and others, and those perhaps would be a priority to investigate.

As far as what somebody might do, **a very basic practice that I often suggest people consider is that anytime they realize that they're in some reactive experience, a reactive state of mind, they're feeling emotionally reactive, their feelings are very exaggerated, they're very impulsive, or they're into sort of hamster wheel type of thinking or blame or apology and stuff, I suggest that they ask, "Oh, I wonder what I might be experiencing right at this moment that I'm trying to escape from?"**

**Not to answer intellectually, but from a Buddhist view, just bring attention into an immediate, embodied, sensation-level experience. Absolutely no interpretation, no commentary, no story. Just hang out with what we would call vulnerability.**

Currently, my best understanding of emotional vulnerability is that underneath the various expressions of that is, I think, just formless panic. So I invite people to check it out and see if there is some moment of panic that has just been touched or triggered, and then see if they are interested in staying as embodied as possible and say, "Well, so what? Is it killing me? Am I turning into some horrible person? Am I turned into a victim? Where is this evidence of harm or damage? Is my survival actually being threatened?"

**Even though my body and my evolutionary biology and my emotions say, "We're going to die, we're going to die, we're going to die," that's what we have to get used to - tolerating that sort of panic and hanging out with it long enough to see if, in fact, I have to do anything about it.**

Because you and I, most people listening to this program, have very fortunate life circumstances, and when we feel that panic, probably 99% of the time, there's not an actual threat. We should check it out in case there is, but probably not. So **we have the luxury of not allowing our evolutionary biology to run the show.**

The more that somebody can just assume that all of our relative experience has this sort of "as if" quality, that starts to help, I think, an attitude of inquiry or investigation anytime there seems to be something that's not working well or that we seem to be captured by, or whatever we call it.

Then, to me, a more general practice of embodied immediacy is very helpful, where maybe once a week or maybe a hundred times a day, we just bring our attention back into embodied, sensation-level experience. No interpretation, no commentary. Just so **we start training ourselves to be present in our immediate, non-conceptual experiencing, not with the intention of getting rid of our conceptual experiencing, but bringing in that same sense we've talked about of contrast or lack of resolution.**

Where, "Oh, I feel like my partner's really making me mad right now. Oh, but if I just stay in my body, I don't even find a sensation of mad. My heart's beating fast, my stomach's tight, my fists are clenched or something like that. Well, so what? Why do I have to do anything about this?"

But then without taking sides, without spiritual bypassing or just saying, "Oh, it's all empty of essential nature. I don't need to do anything. I'm just going to float along on a cloud of bodhisattvic generosity or something like that." Both are there.

**I would say, given my view, that I usually use the formless panic on the Western side when I'm talking about the nature of vulnerability because in my experience, which is limited, that's sort of the bottom line in at least Western depth therapies - emotion, our relationship with emotion.**

**I think it's very helpful for people to be introduced to the deconstructive view and the opening of the appearance of emotion to sensation, and then beneath apparent sensation to this sense of immediate formless panic. And then from a Buddhist point of view, if somebody's interested, I share the view that perhaps even deeper is just open awareness, which provides absolutely no support for personal identity.**

So I would say that I think the Buddhist view goes deeper than the Western view, which sort of stops at emotion, but again, I think the point is to hold both without thinking that we're supposed to choose sides.

My sort of style is that I don't tend to take on beliefs unless I have some personal experience that seems to support that idea. And so it makes sense to me that our various blind spots are contributing to areas of dysfunction on all levels - physical, energetic, emotional, conceptual, social, relational, everything. I don't tend to see things like cancer as something that's separate from me. It's not like, "What am I doing to make the cancer?"

I mean, you and I know, have talked, that I have this cancer that's incurable. It's not killing me, you know. I'm lucky to have some modern drugs, but I don't think of the cancer as something that's happening to me. I think of it as just another part of this complex self that I am. I mean, it's in my body. How could I say it's not me? It's like the mosquito. Okay, that's part of life. I'm part of life, but I'm gonna swat the mosquito. Sorry, mosquito. I'm going to take some drugs to try to stop the cancer from progressing, but I don't tend to think of it as evidence that I'm doing something wrong. I'd be open to exploring that, but I just don't know. I honestly don't know. I don't have an intuition. If I did, I would go with that approach.

But it's more like it seems to me that for everything I'm aware of, every clarity I have, there are literally tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of things I'm not aware of. And so **I don't see what I'm not aware of as the problem, and I don't see my goal at this point as cleaning up all of my neuroses. It's more, to me, to be open to whatever is arising in the present moment. And if it has a neurotic quality to it, hopefully, I'll recognize that because it feels different than being embodied and open and kind and open-hearted,** all that stuff. It feels different.

And hopefully, I'll first of all just be aware of it and then make a choice about whether to investigate it more and whether this inner work would be helpful. But I don't personally have an agenda to be free of cancer or free of neurosis. **My personal agenda is more to live in the experience of freedom while simultaneously doing what I can to improve the quality of my experiencing.**

Well, obviously, from a Buddhist point of view, open awareness, which is the language I would use to point in that direction, there's no language that is going to define or capture what we call freedom. It's sort of almost by definition without ascribable qualities, so you can't ever pin it down. But it's like the finger pointing to the moon. It's helpful to have views and language and practices that point us in a direction because if we don't have those pointers, we could be walking around and never see the moon, but the finger isn't the moon.

So to me, **I prefer the language of conscious participation in open awareness as one way to talk about the experience of unconditional freedom.**

Well, we think we focus on the "need" aspect in that sentence. We don't focus on the healthy inspiration to experience freedom, but the "need" usually has a compulsive quality, and that's what we would address. **The compulsivity is not about freedom.**

**So yes, we then say, "Oh, wait a minute. What is it I'm trying to escape from? What alternative reality am I wishing I lived with? What complaint do I have about reality?" I mean, that's a basic Buddhist view - that one simple way of talking about unnecessary suffering is wanting reality to be other than it is.**

An approach to a path (and it seems to me all paths are relative experiences) has an intention to lead us out of itself. **One view is that we want to just keep investigating views, techniques, theories, practices that take us into immediacy, out of any identification with form.**

But, you know, the Vajrayana view has a lot of what, from an egoic point of view, we would call paradox, which is we're trying to experience something in the present moment that we claim is not present. And if we start having moments of experiencing freedom, let's say, then we can look back and say, "Oh, that wasn't necessary," but apparently, it was necessary to have this experience.

So we hold them both; we don't choose sides.

Well, as we were touching on earlier, **I think it's just very practical to experience more frequent moments of openness, open awareness, open-heartedness, presence, immediacy, embodiment, and things like that because I think the quality of our experience is better. I don't see it as esoteric as much as very practical, but it's not the right way to do it**. Some people are drawn to that, some people are not drawn to that.

**I think it's very easy for anybody on a spiritual path or, in a different way, for people in therapy to project what they found helpful as if other people should too. But I have the opinion (I can't prove anything) that everybody is trying their very best to take care of themselves at every moment of their life, and it's just a matter of whether it's working well enough or not.**

**So when I might be working with somebody, I don't have an agenda to be an agent of change or improvement. I might work in that way, but my intention is to do my best job, as limited as it is, to be a location of awareness. What I try to bring to others in my work is basically the same as what we might try to bring to ourselves. We want to perhaps keep bringing our conscious experience into openness, and all the different versions of that approach, relatively.**

I tend to see psychological work as a support for increasing the frequency of those moments of stepping out of any agenda into immediate open awareness. It's sort of like, anybody who starts meditation, it's probably intelligent for them to start in a shrine room or something like that, where it's quiet, it's sort of uplifted, it's spacious. In a similar way, we can think of our therapeutic work as cleaning up the environment of our inner experiencing.

**We're basically addressing our fascination with distractions, understanding that those distractions serve the function of keeping us out of our panic, let's say, or of openness.**

From that point of view, it's not like there's a problem that's supposed to be healed. It's more like it's not a problem that there's traffic out in the street, but that's not where you want to start meditating, for practical reasons.

There's not a problem that we have what we call neuroses; those are efforts to take care of ourselves. But some people are going to investigate whether the benefit is worth the price tag they pay. Maybe it might make sense to some people to consider that we actually have an investment in generating what we call problems because I think our attention tends to stop at anything that we call a problem because it's like a threat. "Oh, I've got to take care of this threat before I go any deeper. I don't want to be more vulnerable until I've solved this problem."

Whether it's a hundred thousand years ago, it's like, "There's a noise in the bush. I want to figure out what it is. Am I going to eat it, or is it going to eat me before I just sit down on this rock here and take a snooze?"

I think it's helpful just to assume that everything we're doing is our effort to take the best care of ourselves possible, and it's just a matter of whether it's working, and that depends on what our priorities are, what our intentions are.

**I don't see that there's a problem in our unconscious. I think the problem is our agenda that there's not supposed to be an unconscious - some middle-class, educated fantasy that we're supposed to be without limitations.**

How would it be to drop the "pathological" from that statement? Maybe dropping the "pathological" from our cancer that's in our body.

Again, how would it, what would your experience be if you dropped the "tyranny" part of that?

Well, just some curiosity. How do we, how do successful, fortunate life circumstances both support and act as an obstacle to greater wakefulness? Because as soon as we say "tyranny," we've pathologized it and it's a bad thing and now we're supposed to change it.

Yeah, good question. I don't have an answer to that, but I would say that what might be called an actual relative obstacle is something that we actually don't have the capacity to deal with. But from a practice point of view, most of our obstacles aren't literal physical, environmental, situational obstacles. We're going to deal with them however we deal with them.

**There is usually an addition to our immediate experience that is an expression of a refusal to go into experiential intensity. This is just too disturbing, it's too much, too scary, too overwhelming, so I'm going to avoid it, of course, because I think I'm going to die, unconsciously. As soon as I avoid something, then I give it the appearance of being an obstacle. It's not that it's an obstacle or not an obstacle on a psychological level; it's my attitude toward it, and that can be worked with.**

Well, I don't know what enlightenment is or looks like because I'm a confused human, to use that language. I've been around teachers who I think probably are very wakeful. **I don't know what enlightenment means, but that's not part of my reference point. I don't have any goal of enlightenment. My intention is in the present moment, which is to be consciously participating in this endless stream of my experiencing.**

Yes, well, **we could say it's the attitude that one practices. It doesn't mean a self has gotten enlightened.**

Well, I think you are working, you've said, with what could be called reverse meditations, and so I think that can be very practical, not for everyone. Basically, **when somebody has a project that there's some component of compulsivity or a fundamental aggression toward, then I usually assume that that compulsive component is an effort to get away from something that's already being experienced.**

I find it helpful, for myself as much as I'm willing or for others, to invite some investigation: "Well, what is it that's already there? And is it helping you to move in the direction you think you want to move in by ignoring something that's already there?"

You know, you're not looking to work with it. It creates unnecessary suffering, it generates the sense of being divided against oneself. You think it's a problem which prevents greater vulnerabilities.

**So I think it's very helpful when somebody has that goal of transcendence to invite them to come back to the messy, embodied, immediate experience that I'm just a confused, messy human and I probably will be till I die. And what's your objection to being who you happen to find yourself to be?**

---

**Andrew:** I'll just say that before you can become a Buddha, you have to become fully human, and maybe being fully human is what it means to become a Buddha?

**Bruce:** I don't know, but I wouldn't say you have to do this before that happens.

I know you didn't mean it, but **people listening to you might hear "just lighten up," you know, "celebrate," as a prescription or a command even, but that's not a very light way of being - to have an agenda that I should be other than I am.**

And so I think that **one way of talking about our practice is that, for the foreseeable future, most of them can best be understood as recovery practices, not as achievement practices or prevention practices. I just assume I'm going to go off into self-absorbed states, into self-commentary, and then if I have a moment of awareness that cuts that apparent solidity, I have a choice, and I can come back to my intention, my practice of being present, especially perhaps in some embodied way.** But then I'm gone, then I come back, then I'm gone, come back.

**So an analogy I sometimes offer is like if somebody's riding a bike, you stay upright by cooperating with always being out of balance. Yeah, there's no achievement. And so part of our work is to learn to have less extreme swings because the bigger the swing, the more anxiety is put into the system, and the more anxiety we put into our system, the more tendency toward wanting resolution, going into survival mode, losing access to some adult capacities, black and white organization, things like that.**

So the more we can recognize when we're starting to feel a little off on one way, like, "Oh, I'm going for freedom," "Oh, I'm getting absorbed in my dramas," and catch it more and more quickly, I think there's less unnecessary energy spent on crisis management and more potential for, "Oh, I'm not worried about falling at the moment, so I can look around."

---

Well, it seems to me that it's helpful to consider anxiety on several levels, not just as if it's a monolithic reality, because what we're dealing with is our experience of reality. We're never dealing with anxiety as an objectively existing thing, like everything. And so I think it's very helpful to understand the likelihood that anxiety and fear are probably hardwired and at the center of our evolutionary biology. Probably anxiety and fear have been on the planet millions of years before there were any humans and higher life forms. It's what keeps a species alive, basically - to put survival as a higher priority than improving the quality of your life at that moment. If you don't survive, you don't pass on the genes, you're not there tomorrow.

So I think all of us would probably find that anxiety is just a part of being human. **But nobody likes to feel anxiety. We don't like to feel scared or powerless or angry or anything like that. So it's very natural, not accurate, that most of us are going to look for an apparent cause of reality. "I'm anxious because I might lose my job. I'm anxious because of climate change. I'm anxious because my partner is late coming home at work." Actually, you know, whatever, "I might have cancer."**

**So I think we have an impulse to try to have an explanation for anxiety because, unconsciously, if there's an explanation, a cause, then we can sort of hold out the idea that there's a solution. And if only I fix the cause, then I can have a life free of anxiety. So most people are unconsciously always attributing a cause for their anxiety, where I personally think it's just a part of being human. And if that's accurate, it's probably better to practice and train ourselves to have a relationship with anxiety, period, with no explanation.**

And that's often what I invite people to experiment with - just keep bringing awareness into embodied experience, sensational experience, no interpretation, especially around anxiety and fear, and see, well, okay, where's the harm? Where's the actual threat to our survival? We're not going to get rid of it. We have to learn to work with our biology, but perhaps start to tease apart our somewhat unconscious identification with it.

It's like, you know, the first three chakras, the biological chakras - you don't get a human life without them, but we don't want to stop there. We want to explore higher levels of human potential. But that means we have to have a relationship, not be in denial or repression or something.

So I think it's very important to train ourselves to have the attitude that I'll probably have moments of anxiety many, many times every day of my life until I die. So what? You know, that sucks. I don't like it. It feels like I'm gonna die. **But okay, after we've practiced that for several thousand times, we may find a sort of a willingness to feel that panic and not think we immediately have to do something about it. You know, somebody has to check that out for themselves. It's not a belief system.**

And then on a psychological level, one view in the West is that anxiety can be understood as a signal that disowned, repressed material is threatening to come out into our awareness. And it could be because of something's happening in our life, it could be our environment, as you were saying, you know, politics, climate change, everything.

And **it could be because we're maturing and we're starting to have more confidence in ourselves and have some life experience and more resilience. And so, unconsciously, we're starting to give ourselves the signal that what was not workable as a child - my rage, my grief - might start to arise, and we should expect some anxiety about that.** That's a big topic, of course.

Another aspect on the psychological level is that some people have described fear as a response to immediate threat and anxiety as an anticipation of possible threat. So when somebody's not actually being threatened, anxiety has this sort of fertile ground because I'm anxious, but it hasn't happened yet. And that's very fertile territory for me to then project all sorts of unresolved issues. And so, often, **anxiety is a sort of a ground for me to continue projecting my unresolved, conditioned history, and then I take it seriously and then act as if it's a real, immediate problem.**

But **if we can train ourselves just to stay with immediate experience of anxiety without any interpretation, without resolution, we may find it's really disturbing - that's the nature of it. It's supposed to be disturbing. That's what kept our species alive. It grabs our attention away from immediate distraction or pleasure or something like that.**

**But so what, you know? We're not going to suddenly not be non-biological beings. Then on a more spiritual path level, I would personally understand anxiety as an accurate response to openness from egoic experiencing. And again, egoic experiencing I don't see as wrong, I just see it as not accurate.**

**So we can consider that our anxiety, in addition to the biological and the psychological, we could use our anxiety as a little signal to check out, "Am I trying to escape from unconditional openness right now or just open awareness?"** I mean, yes, of course, we could be pretty sure of the answer to that.

So it's more about how am I doing it and is it necessary? Could I tolerate maybe a second or two of no definition, just presence? You know, yeah, personally, at this point in my life, I see it more as, as a confused human, I see it more as a practice of having a relationship with openness rather than some achievement of openness. If that happens, that'll be nice, you know. It's, I'm not counting on it.

> But I do find that the more frequently we invite and actually have a momentary experience of freedom, openness, presence, embodiment, whatever we call it, it starts to actually affect the texture of our ongoing experiencing. Like if we were wearing this mask that was just a solid front, we could imagine that a moment of awareness is like taking a little needle and poking a hole in it. And if we do that very frequently, at some point, we actually start seeing through that apparent solidity without having to make it go away.

> And so I happen to be an advocate of a lot of short, incremental practices. I think that's certainly a Dzogchen view. I think, yeah, but that seems to me to make a lot of sense - **tolerating openness, tolerating formless panic, in very, very small doses.** Like, hey, whatever, if it's one second, great. The point is to bring our intention into that experience without worrying about how long it is, but to do it frequently rather than sit there for half an hour trying to achieve openness or something like that.

Fear reifies the future. Anger reifies the past.

I would agree that we can learn to use anxiety, fear, anger, grief as very accurate, valuable energies on our path work. But **I think a possible temptation for a spiritual practitioner would be to relate to all anxiety as existential anxiety and dismiss the fact that there is biological anxiety and there is psychological anxiety, and different levels of experience, I think, require different interventions, different practices, different understandings.**

Some people potentially might use that with what we call spiritual bypassing to just say, "Oh, it's just insubstantial in its nature." But well, geez, you know, every day of my life, I'm going to feel anxious because I'm a biological being.

Relating to it properly at a biological level is not going to be the same as relating to it as a spiritual path level. Yeah, I might actually want to change my physical environment or change my relationship or something.

**I tend to see everything as an ongoing experiment, we're just falling through space, winging it, and we take our best shot, and then we see how things unfold. And if they're going in the direction we like, we do more of it, and if not, we do less of it.**

As far as relationships, well, first of all, obviously, from a Buddhist point of view, it makes sense to me that all of our relative experiencing is relational in its nature, and that, as far as I can understand, it's only open awareness that is without relative constructive nature. So all of our path is relative, and so we don't take any of it too seriously, but we make use of it, I think.

**I would agree with the basic idea that we're not actually in control of what arises in the stream of experiencing. We have influence, but that's different than control. And underneath that is even an unexamined fantasy, often, that there is a self that somehow has either influence or control. But it's all just co-arising, you know, we're just winging it, you know. It's not even a "we," but anyway, on a relative level, we of course talk that way.**

And so then the way we relate to our experience is what we have the most influence over, usually. And it seems to me that it makes sense to do what works, given our intention, given our priorities and our values.

If somebody's interested in more experience of freedom, I think it's helpful to practice unconditional practices - unconditional kindness, unconditional acceptance, unconditional immediacy, embodiment, like that - because I think those, the unconditional aspect of it, is sort of an approximation of open awareness.

Just like I would say in therapy, **I tend to start with most people with the view of personal responsibility because I think until we are willing to practice personal responsibility, it's very likely that we are going to stop with the appearance of the problem of sort of being a victim of life and being resentful toward life, whether it's our partner, our job, or the politics or anything.**

**And again, it doesn't mean I'm responsible for what's arising, but I'm responsible for how I work with what's arising.**

And then **out of that ground of personal responsibility starts to be the possibility of choice and challenging compulsivity. And one way to challenge compulsivity is to, as we talked about earlier, intentionally practice exactly what we're avoiding and find out it's not going to kill us.** We may never prefer that, but it's, "Oh, I could do my preferred self-sufficiency thing, but I could tolerate feeling dependent," or vice versa, or whatever.

So then as we start to have more experience of choice, we're starting to introduce in the middle some open ground because now we can't really take sides and say one is the right way to be. And so out of that, then, is a more conscious practice of holding and tolerating contradictory experience with no fantasy of resolution ever.

And then as a next step, we can practice *not knowing* as sort of a more focused attention to that middle ground, but it's still from the, it's still on the side of relative experience because it's not knowing as if we should know.

And then, of course, we might then have more frequent moments of just open awareness, which has no reference point. But anyway, that's not exactly what you're asking, but I think it's a useful progression in one's personal work.

Basically, **when somebody has a project that there's some component of compulsivity or a fundamental aggression toward, then I usually assume that that compulsive component is an effort to get away from something that's already being experienced.**

I find it helpful, for myself as much as I'm willing or for others, to invite some investigation: "Well, what is it that's already there? And is it helping you to move in the direction you think you want to move in by ignoring something that's already there?"

You know, you're not looking to work with it. It creates unnecessary suffering, it generates the sense of being divided against oneself. You think it's a problem which prevents greater vulnerabilities.

So I think **it's very helpful when somebody has that sort of goal of transcendence to invite them to come back to the messy, embodied, immediate experience that I'm just a confused, messy human and I probably will be till I die. And what's your objection to being who you happen to find yourself to be?**

Like everything, who knows? **When it comes to shadow and relationship, I never know why I have my various preferences, but the explanation I would come up with is that I think for most people, "shadow" has a negative connotation. I think that the connotation is, "Oh, there's this sort of bad or some problematic part of me, and the point is to bring it out into awareness,"** which is sort of Western depth therapy. It's like that which is unconscious made conscious is sort of a mantra of depth therapies. It's not wrong; it's very valuable.

**However, the idea of "shadow" to me carries that sort of idea of "I need to change something," rather than considering, well, you don't get to be a being in light without a shadow, let's say. And so, why do I think it's wrong to have disowned parts of myself?**

**I could spend 10 hours a day for the rest of my life mining my unconscious experience to try to bring everything out into open awareness, which on a practical level could be very helpful, but is that really how I want to spend my life trying to improve myself? What about just being at peace with being a confused human who's always going to have neuroses, and if they cause problems, I'll work with them; otherwise, why do I think I'm supposed to somehow get rid of being human? You know, I think there's some pretty fundamental aggression underneath that, which is very basic to Western culture.**

Well, this is more on the side of Western therapy, of course. **But the view that I think is usually supported when somebody starts looking deeper is that whatever we have disowned in ourselves, first of all, again, my view is not that it's bad or neurotic or pathological, it's just that this was the best effort I made as a child to adapt to a distorted emotional environment, and that a healthy adaptation to a distorted environment requires a distorted survival strategy.**

But then, of course, we get identified with it, it gets internalized, and we carry it into adulthood where it's now decades out of date. **Most of us have come into adulthood with disowned experience, which really means that I am making a constantly effortful, creative, disciplined sort of practice of pretending that I'm not feeling what I'm feeling.** It's not actually buried, you know. Every moment, on some level, we have to make a lot of effort to keep this out of our awareness because it's there. If I said, "Oh, I'm going to ignore my toes because I don't like the way they look," it takes a lot of effort to not look down there.

But anyway, **when we come into adulthood with what we call these disowned energies, they're still there, and so they have to be related to. But if I'm not willing to have a conscious, embodied, kind relationship with myself, then a very practical but not helpful strategy is to find a partner who apparently specializes in being exactly that way. That way, it's very obvious that the location of that energy is over there with them, and then I can complain about them being that way but never take effective action to change anything, not have effective boundaries, or ask them to change their behavior or talk with them about how it affects me. I'll just have this attitude of complaint that I can hold, and then I'm very happy that they're the location of these disowned experiences, mostly feelings.**

And if it's a good neurotic fit, a codependent fit, of course they're doing the same with me. When I've worked with couples, I'd say maybe nine out of ten couples have this sort of complementarity that's operating somewhat unconsciously, where they have ritualized their relationship, and each actually experiences the other as the cause of their difficult feelings. And it's a great agreement: "Hey, I'll blame you for my difficult experience, you blame me for yours. I'll complain about you, you complain about me, and neither of us will have any effective boundaries or do anything about it, because if we did, we'd be in danger of owning it ourselves. So, if we are pretending to not be aware of that aspect of ourselves, we don't have to do anything to find it. It's like the Dzogchen approach - we just relax into immediate experience and stay embodied, because we're not going to find any evidence of a problem, I think, ever outside of concepts. We're going to find pain, we're going to find activation, we're going to find sort of shaky sensations or whatever, but we're not going to find problems.

And so, the more we practice embodied immediacy, especially if we practice coming back to that many times a day, not waiting for a problem, just making it a habit of immediacy, then it's possible every moment we do that and find (because then we check it out and see, "Well, where's the problem?") every moment we find that there's no evidence of a problem in our experiencing. It's possible that gradually we start to undermine our fantasy that there's a problem in us, that maybe my rage, my grief, my jealousy, my sadism, whatever it is, isn't a problem. It's just an aspect of my experience that I have to learn to work with.

If I start being more intimate with myself, then I can tolerate perhaps being more intimate with my partner. But if I refuse to be intimate with aspects of my experience, I have to keep my partner at a certain distance and sort of handle things in a unilateral way, because to me, intimacy is guaranteed to be inherently provocative, disturbing, never resolvable. And so our partners are guaranteed to trigger any unresolved issues we carry just through the friction of being so close and engaged.

Most of us ritualize our relationship in ways that guarantee this distance through apparent problems, and there are some predictable things like chronic conflict, miscommunication, loss of sexuality, one-up/one-down dynamics, turning into buddies running a family, absorption at work, absorption with parenting - things like that, all of which have distancing functions because we are inaccurately relying on our partner to be what we're not willing to take responsibility for in ourselves, our codependency.

And so, working with thousands of couples over the years, I tried to recall, and I don't think I probably worked with even 10 couples who have come into therapy asking for help to be more separate, which is really the work that has to happen at first, you know, to challenge this emotional fusion. But because couples use these apparent problems as a way of regulating their inappropriate emotional fusion, most couples have the fantasy that the problem is not enough connection, so they want help in feeling more connected. And that's supported by our culture, where we are told that intimacy is synonymous with closeness and connection, rather than the possibility that healthy intimacy requires the never-resolvable disturbance of the fact that we're existentially alone, personally responsible, separate, and we're also completely interconnected, want to give and receive love, care about others, want to be cared about, etc.

So most couples end up having to find problematic ways of introducing separateness in relationship as a relief from the claustrophobia of inappropriate fusion, and then think that the problematic ways they get separateness are the problem in the relationship.

I would say, go drink a beer and kick your dog. I'm not in control of your life. I'm not going to beat my head against the brick wall.

Well, my experience, which may or may not be accurate, is that I experience pretty much every moment as fresh, and so it doesn't really matter if I'm saying the same thing - it's fresh. If I buy some orange juice this morning, I'm not gonna say, "Oh, what a drag, I had orange juice yesterday morning." If I look out at the ocean, I'm not going to say, "Oh, this is so dead, the ocean was there yesterday. What's the meaning of life?" That's all concept.

And so, the more we stay out of substituting concept for immediate experience (we still have to use concepts), every moment is fresh. It's very hard to burn out or to get cynical. Those are attitudes, those are formulas that we use to avoid immediacy. They're not descriptions of reality. I don't experience getting tired of saying similar things, and because everything is fresh, actually, we've never been in this moment before. It's just reality.

Every moment has a quality of surprise, and so it's not like I'm in my formula now, I'm going to get surprised. But from doing this a long time, I find that certain patterns tend to be often useful for people to investigate, and if it doesn't fit, it doesn't fit. If I don't have an agenda that it's supposed to, and I'm not the best fit for everybody, so if somebody doesn't find my approach helpful, I'm very supportive of their looking for somebody with a better fit for them.

As far as the reductionist thing, I think I would agree that as we get down into more fundamental, immediate, embodied, non-interpretive experiencing, we increase our potential for deeper transformative change. And I think it's very important not to take what's deeper as if it's more true than what's superficial.

A non-dual approach, in my limited understanding, is that relative and absolute are inseparable and don't manifest as the same. Relative experience is just as valid, but there are reasons why we might want to have conscious participation in more open, absolute experience.

Part of it is that we then don't take either so seriously. If we have both the depth and the surface, it's hard to take the surface so seriously. But also, if we don't try to escape from the surface, then it's hard to take refuge in the absolute, which a lot of practitioners try to do, of course.

So I prefer to hold both, as we've talked about today, round and round, hold both with no resolution ever.

Big issue, of course, as we've talked about. At least my view is that anything that's a view is limited inherently. And so it's not "Is it limited?" It's just "How is it limited?"

It's like if you had a dark room and you took a flashlight out and you shined it around the room, whatever the flashlight shined on would get illuminated, but everything else is dark. So that clarification is very specific to a certain range of phenomena and not very helpful for other things.

If somebody is committed to only meditating, it might be appropriate for somebody to say, "Hey, just gotta meditate harder." Okay, maybe in some traditional cultures like Tibetan culture, maybe that was accurate. It would be like saying, "Hey, if you believe in reincarnation, it may be it's like a rock at the ocean and the waves are going to keep hitting it, and you know, in a thousand years, the rock will be gone." Okay, no problem.

But if somebody happens to be more Western, it's possible that maybe that's not the most effective response, especially from, I think, a more non-dual view, which is you don't take sides between relative and absolute. So you do what helps somebody experience more wakefulness and more open-heartedness, more compassion, more presence, whatever we call it. And so it's a constant experiment.

It's not like, "Oh, you should be in therapy." It's like, "Why don't you give it a try if you're feeling stuck?" Or somebody's in therapy and they say, "It's just not touching something that is deeper, but I can't put my finger on it." Well, why don't you try meditation? See if that is interesting or helpful.

Again, I think it's most useful just to assume that we're profoundly limited and just be curious about what those limitations are, rather than entertain some idea, "I wonder if I'm limited." And that's true, it doesn't matter if you're a practitioner or not.

I have a bias, which I can't support at all, which is that I think that probably 98 percent of the people in any tradition are using it more as a religion than as a spiritual path. They're using it as a way to live a decent life with good values. They want companionship, they want some reassurance that they're doing it "right," things like that, which is okay, as well as all the distortions of religion. **But religion tends to always point our attention back into itself, whereas to me, a spiritual path is always pointing us out of itself.**

From that point of view, I think spiritual path work has more congruence between the different traditions than somebody using Buddhism as a spiritual path, I think, has with people using it as a religion.

So if somebody says, "Hey, you know, Buddhism doesn't need therapy," well, maybe. But that sort of attitude is a formula. And if they want to drink a beer and kick the dog, you know, why spend your energy trying to talk them out of it?

Yeah, you can say, "Hey, if it's working, great. But why are we having this discussion if it's working?"

I think it's great that there is this reawakening of such a potentially powerful tool (psychedelics). I did a lot of psychedelics in my 20s. I was in San Francisco, you know, I guess it was in '69 back then, which was its own scene. But I was doing acid every weekend for six months and it just got too much, you know. I started feeling a little nuts, so I stopped.

But at this point, every once in a while, I think, "Oh, that would be a good idea. I'd like to try that again." But I haven't, you know. I don't feel urgent about it, but I think, you know, I've worked with a lot of people as clients who have really benefited. And some people, of course, have bad trips or something, so we need to be cautious because it's so powerful.

But I think it's potentially a very positive re-emergence in this whole arena, that people can be introduced to open mind experiences, let's say, without having to meditate for 20 years. And then maybe they're not even having it anyway.

But I do think it's very helpful, like Ken Wilber's differentiation between state of mind, states, and structures. So somebody can have a genuine open mind experience, but then after they return, they're going to integrate that and understand it according to their current level of characterological development, let's say.

And so it's very important to continue one's personal work, meditation, therapy, whatever people do, and not mistake momentary experiences of openness as some achievement. It has to be integrated, and it'll get integrated in terms of one's current capacity for openness.

Nothing that we haven't touched on, I would just say that I think it's very helpful to consider that most of what we claim to be a problem could be understood as a retreat into self-absorption. And I see self-absorption not as pathological, but as a very primitive effort to take the best care of ourselves possible.

It's like a turtle that pulls back into its shell. That's not pathological, but if it stayed in its shell for the next 10 years, that would become a problem. It would probably be dead. So we learn these contractive strategies, as you said earlier, when we're very vulnerable, very powerless as children. And because they work, we tend to internalize them and then carry them into adulthood, where now they are out of date.

But I think it's very potentially helpful for somebody to consider training themselves to relate to what we call neurosis, what we call problems, as an expression of our best effort to take the best care of ourselves possible, and practice unconditional kindness toward these strategies rather than dismissing them as pathological or negative or they have to be healed or there's a problem there.

And if somebody wants, anytime they find themselves claiming there's a problem, they could just ask, "I wonder if I'm retreating into self-absorption right now? And if so, I wonder what I feel hurt about, what I feel scared about, what feels threatening right now?"

And one evidence of self-absorption is when our commentary is all about me. "Oh, I feel this. I didn't do that. I'm a failure. Oh, I'm a great person." You know, "I, I, me." That's just a signal. We can start training ourselves to recognize that it's not about that commentary. It's about "I'm pulling back out of some vulnerability, some formless panic, whatever, perhaps."

And to just keep in mind the **Buddhist simultaneity of awareness and compassion, which, you know, we could say is just being willing to be honest with our experience and unconditionally kind toward anything and everything that arises.** I think both those are very reliable reference points.

(On depression) At that moment that you're feeling heavy and dark, you could ask, "I wonder what I might be feeling at this moment that I'm trying to escape from?" And not intellectual, just re-embody, you know.

And anyway, I think depression is very complex from what I can tell. It's not my specialty, but I think there's a lot of evidence that there is a biological basis for depression for many people. And if it's a biological cause, you probably are gonna benefit from a biological intervention, whether it's exercise, diet, sleep, or whether it's meds or something. I'm not anti-med.

But although, actually, just as a reference, a number of people who have what could be called treatment-resistant depression have really benefited from microdosing psilocybin. That's a real benefit for some people. But I think also there's the emotional, psychological arising of depression, and that's the side of things I would have some, you know, ability to help work with.

I would say it's not like I don't see it (depression) as a climax of self-absorption. I would see it as a retreat from intimacy with our own immediate experiencing, that it has to be maintained usually through stories and unproductive behavior, things like that. So I usually see it as serving a function. I'm usually more interested in the function that what we call our problems are serving, rather than some essential nature to them.

But anybody who has a biological basis of depression almost certainly is going to end up with a psychological component just from having lived with that for a number of years or decades. So it's complex to work with.

But on a subtle level, I would say that any time we're in a state of self-absorption, it's sort of depressing, because we're alienating ourselves from not only life, but from our own aliveness at that point. We're refusing to consciously participate in the truth of our immediate experience.

So even at the existential level, when people say, "Oh, there's something missing from my life. I feel things are sort of dead or flat," I would say it's probably not their circumstances. It could be, but it's probably a refusal to participate in the truth of their immediate experience, which is probably very vulnerable and disturbing because the experience is very intense, it's not flat. I would say that on the therapy side, we understand that as pulling away from, contracting away from our always present vulnerability.

We are vulnerable because we're a human, we're a sensitive life form, not because there's a problem. And then underneath that is that formless panic, I think.

But then on the Buddhist side, it's that always present, maybe not so conscious recognition, living with the reality that there's no support for our personal identity. That's why we have to prop it up all the time. If it were there, we wouldn't have to do anything to maintain it.

The real metta and maitri might be the permission to be a messy and confused human being.
